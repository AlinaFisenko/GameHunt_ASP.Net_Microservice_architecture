Here are a few common ones:\n\n1. **Database Connection Issues**: The application might not be able to connect to the database. This could be due to incorrect connection strings, network issues, or the database server being down.\n\n2. **Schema Mismatch**: The current database schema might not match what the migration expects. This can happen if there have been manual changes to the database schema that weren\u0027t reflected in the migrations.\n\n3. **Data Issues**: The migration might be trying to enforce a constraint (like a unique key or a not-null constraint) that is violated by existing data in the database.\n\n4. **Version Control Issues**: If migrations are not applied in the correct order, or if a migration is missing, this can cause failures.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors in the Migration Script**: If there are any syntax errors in the migration script, the migration will fail.\n\nTo diagnose the issue, check the error message that you\u0027re getting when the migration fails.
